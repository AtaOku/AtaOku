# Hey, I'm Ata 👋

I'm the kind of person who sees a tool and immediately wants to know what's behind it.

I'm finishing my **MSc in Management & Technology** at TU Munich — Marketing major, Computer Science minor. Before that, a double major in **Business Administration & Law** at Koç University, focused on intellectual property. I apparently couldn't pick just one field, so I picked three.

Currently exploring the space where **marketing meets AI meets compliance** — building tools that apply classical AI techniques to real marketing problems, and writing a thesis on how AI trade secrets fit into the EU legal framework.

## 🔨 What I'm Building

**[MarTech × AI Portfolio](https://csp-campaign-planner.streamlit.app)** — A series of projects that take algorithms from my TUM AI course and apply them to marketing challenges I've actually encountered at work:

- 🎯 **CSP Campaign Planner** — Constraint satisfaction for campaign scheduling *(live)*
- 📊 **Bayesian Purchase Predictor** — Probabilistic customer decision modeling *(next)*
- 🔄 **HMM Customer Lifecycle** — Hidden state tracking for churn prediction *(planned)*
- 💰 **MDP Dynamic Pricing** — Optimal pricing via value iteration *(planned)*
- 🔍 **A* Influencer Optimizer** — Informed search for influencer selection *(planned)*
- ⚖️ **Logic Campaign Engine** — Rule-based compliance checking *(planned)*

## 🧰 Things I Work With

**Marketing & Analytics:** GA4 · GTM · Looker Studio · Tableau · BigQuery · HubSpot · Semrush  
**AI & Code:** Python · SQL · Java · OR-Tools · Pandas · ML/NLP basics  
**Paid Channels:** Google Ads · Meta Ads · TikTok Ads · Programmatic  
**Legal/Compliance:** EU AI Act · GDPR · Trade Secrets Directive · IP Law

## 📍 Previously

- **Infineon Technologies** — Marketing Analyst (AI agents, automation, dashboards)
- **IUS Startup** — Co-Founder (AI-based IP monitoring)
- **Digital Pals** — Growth Specialist (multi-channel campaigns, GA4, HubSpot)
